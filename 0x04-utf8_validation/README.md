# 0x04. UTF-8 Validation

## Description

This project involves validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The validation process requires a solid understanding of bitwise operations, the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and Python programming skills. By working through this project, you'll apply bitwise operations and logical reasoning to ensure that data is correctly encoded in UTF-8.

## Concepts and Resources

### 1. Bitwise Operations in Python
- **Bitwise Operations:** Learn how to manipulate bits in Python using operators like AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), and shifts (`<<`, `>>`).
- **Resources:**
  - [Python Bitwise Operators](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#bitwise-operations-on-integer-types)

### 2. UTF-8 Encoding Scheme
- **UTF-8 Rules:** Familiarize yourself with the UTF-8 encoding rules, including how characters are encoded into one or more bytes. Understand the patterns that indicate a valid UTF-8 encoded character.
- **Resources:**
  - [UTF-8 Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UTF-8)
  - [Characters, Symbols, and the Unicode Miracle](https://manishearth.github.io/blog/2017/01/14/utf-8-and-unicode/)
  - [The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2003/10/08/the-absolute-minimum-every-software-developer-absolutely-positively-must-know-about-unicode-and-character-sets-no-excuses/)

### 3. Data Representation
- **Byte-Level Data:** Understand how to represent and work with data at the byte level. This includes handling the least significant bits (LSB) of integers to simulate byte data.

### 4. List Manipulation in Python
- **Lists:** Learn to iterate through lists, access elements, and use list comprehensions.
- **Resources:**
  - [Python Lists](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists)

### 5. Boolean Logic
- **Logical Operations:** Apply logical operations to make decisions within the program, especially in the context of validating UTF-8 encoding.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash

   ```
3. **Run the Script:**
   Execute the main script to validate a dataset for UTF-8 encoding.
   ```bash
   python3 0-validate_utf8.py
   ```
