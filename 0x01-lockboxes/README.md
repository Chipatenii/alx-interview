# Lockboxes

Lockboxes is a Python-based project that implements an algorithm to solve the problem of opening a set of locked boxes. Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and the goal is to determine if all boxes can be opened starting from the first box.

## Description

The Lockboxes project provides a solution to a classic algorithmic problem often encountered in coding interviews and competitive programming. The problem is to check if you can access all the boxes given that each box contains keys to other boxes.

## Algorithm

The algorithm used in this project follows these steps:
1. Start with the first box.
2. Use the keys in the current box to open other boxes.
3. Keep track of the boxes that have been opened.
4. Repeat the process until there are no more boxes to open with the available keys.
5. Check if all boxes have been opened.

## Installation

To run the Lockboxes project, you'll need Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using `pip`.

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chipatenii/lockboxes.git
    cd lockboxes
    ```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the Lockboxes algorithm, you need to provide a list of boxes, where each box is represented by a list of keys. Here is an example of how to run the algorithm:

```python
from lockboxes import canUnlockAll

# Example: List of boxes
boxes = [[1], [2], [3], []]

# Check if all boxes can be opened
result = canUnlockAll(boxes)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

## Testing

To run the tests for the Lockboxes project, you can use the following command:

```bash
python -m unittest discover tests
```

This will run all the unit tests located in the `tests` directory.
