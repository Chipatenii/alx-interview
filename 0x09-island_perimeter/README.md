# 0. Island Perimeter

## Description

The **"0. Island Perimeter"** project requires applying knowledge of algorithms, data structures (specifically matrices or 2D lists), and iterative or conditional logic to solve a geometric problem within a grid context. The goal is to calculate the perimeter of a single island in a grid, where the grid is represented by a 2D array of integers.

This project tests your ability to navigate and analyze 2D arrays and apply logical operations to determine the conditions necessary for perimeter calculation.

## Concepts Needed

### 1. 2D Arrays (Matrices)
- **Accessing and Iterating**: You must understand how to access and iterate over elements in a 2D array.
- **Navigation**: Be familiar with how to navigate through adjacent cells horizontally and vertically in a grid.

### 2. Conditional Logic
- **Perimeter Calculation**: Learn how to apply conditions to determine whether a particular cell contributes to the perimeter of the island.

### 3. Counting Techniques
- **Counting Edges**: Develop a method to count the edges that contribute to the islandâ€™s perimeter.

### 4. Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Break the Problem Down**: Break the task into smaller parts, such as identifying land cells (represented by `1` in the grid) and calculating their contribution to the perimeter.

### 5. Python Programming
- **Nested Loops**: Use nested loops to iterate over grid cells.
- **Conditional Statements**: Implement conditions to check the status of adjacent cells to determine if a perimeter should be added.
