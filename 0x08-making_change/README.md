# 0x08. Making Change

## Overview
This project, **Making Change**, is a dynamic programming and greedy algorithm challenge where you are tasked with solving the classic **coin change problem**. The goal is to find the **minimum number of coins** required to achieve a given total, given a set of coin denominations.

### Key Information
- **Project Name**: 0x08. Making Change
- **Language**: Python
- **Weight**: 1
- **Start Date**: Sep 17, 2024, 5:00 AM
- **End Date**: Sep 24, 2024, 5:00 AM
- **Auto QA Review**: 0.0/16 mandatory
- **Total Score**: 0.0%

This project is part of the ALX software engineering curriculum and focuses on applying algorithms to real-world problems.

## Concepts Needed
### 1. Greedy Algorithms
- Understand the concept of **greedy algorithms** and how they apply to the coin change problem.
- Recognize situations where a greedy solution may not be optimal.

### 2. Dynamic Programming
- Master the **dynamic programming** approach, which involves solving problems by breaking them into smaller sub-problems.
- Learn how to solve the coin change problem using dynamic programming for an optimal solution.

### 3. Algorithmic Complexity
- Analyze the **time and space complexity** of different algorithmic solutions to ensure efficiency.
  
### 4. Problem-Solving Strategies
- Explore both **iterative** and **recursive** methods in dynamic programming.
- Learn to manipulate Python lists effectively and write efficient looping constructs.

## Requirements
- **Editors**: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- **Interpreter**: Python 3.4.3, Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- Code must follow **PEP 8 style guidelines (v1.7.x)**
- All files must be executable and end with a new line.
- The project directory must contain a `README.md` file.

## Task Breakdown

### 0. Change Comes From Within
#### Objective
Write a function `makeChange(coins, total)` that determines the **fewest number of coins** needed to meet a given total amount.

#### Prototype
```python
def makeChange(coins, total):
    # Your code here
```

#### Input
- `coins`: A list of integers representing coin denominations.
- `total`: The target amount you want to achieve.

#### Output
- Return the fewest number of coins needed to meet the total.
- If the total is `0` or less, return `0`.
- If the total cannot be achieved with the available coins, return `-1`.

#### Example Usage
```bash
$ ./0-main.py
7
-1
```
